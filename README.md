AZCoreRecord
------------

The active record pattern, a way to deal with relational structures through dedicated functions for insertion, updates, and deletion, has been popularized by languages like Ruby for their ease in dealing with database data in an object-oriented way.

Heavily derived from [Magical Record for Core Data](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord), `AZCoreRecord` strives to bring effortless fetching, saving, importing, and ubiquity to Core Data on iOS and OS X.

The primary benefits you'll get out of AZCoreRecord include:

* Cleaner Core Data-related code
* Automatic handling of contexts, stores, and models
* Clear, simple, one-line fetches, searches, and deletes
* Drop-in support for Ubiquity/iCloud - the first of its kind.

AZCoreRecord is built using ARC against the iOS 5.0/OS X 10.7 SDK. It is backwards compatible to iOS 4.3 and OS X 10.6.

## Installation

AZCoreRecord can be added to a project using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/alloy/cocoapods).

### Manual Installation

* Download or clone AZCoreRecord.
* In your Xcode Project, add all the `.h` and `.m` files from the AZCoreRecord folder into your project. 
* In the build settings of your target or project, change "Other Linker Flags" to `-ObjC -all_load`. Make sure your app is linked with Core Data.
* Insert `#import "AZCoreRecord.h"` anywhere in your project.

## Usage

### Setting up the Core Data Stack

If you donâ€™t want auto migration, an in-memory store, or a special name for your stack, simply start working! The first time the default managed object context is accessed, the entire stack is initialized automatically.

Otherwise, somewhere in your app delegate, likely `-applicationDidFinishLaunching:withOptions:` use any combination of the following setup calls from the `AZCoreRecordManager` metaclass:

	+ (void)setStackShouldAutoMigrateStore: (BOOL) shouldMigrate;
	+ (void)setStackShouldUseInMemoryStore: (BOOL) inMemory;
	+ (void)setStackStoreName: (NSString *) name;
	+ (void)setStackStoreURL: (NSURL *) name;
	+ (void)setStackModelName: (NSString *) name;
	+ (void)setStackModelURL: (NSURL *) name;

Each call configures a piece of your Core Data stack, and will automatically get used whenever your app tries to use a AZCoreRecord method.
