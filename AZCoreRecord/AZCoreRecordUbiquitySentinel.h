 Call this method to check if Ubiquity is available. You can call this method on
 the main thread. You can also use this method, together with
 NSUbiquityIdentityDidChangeNotification or
 AZUbiquityIdentityDidChangeNotification to detect when a user changes their
 iCloud account. You can copy or encode a ubiquity identity token, and you can
 compare it to previously-obtained values by using the isEqual: method.
 
 This method returns nil if no ubiquity containers are available because the
 user has disabled them, or if the user is not logged in to iCloud.
